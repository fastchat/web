# FastChat Web Client

This is a web client for FastChat. It will require a FastChat server running locally to connect to. In the future, this could be used to connect to remote hosts, but that will require some work with the socket.io client.

For now, and simplicity, the server can be started with node.

`node coffee_bridge.js`
